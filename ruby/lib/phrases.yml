# YAML Phrasebook for TinyMUD
#############################
# Note: We have ported 99.9% of the strings, there might be the odd few lurking away!
# Some formatted output strings, e.g. name(#number) are not here - As they do not contain
# static text, but they do influence presentation. It would be possible to add these
# also. Lastly the majority of the tests use the phrasebook. But again there is a chance
# we have missed the odd phrase, especially flags. Any missed conversions will show up
# quickly as the tests are comprehensive.
