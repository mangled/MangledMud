 page <player> --- tell player that you are looking for them (cost 1 penny)
 gripe <message> --- Complain to the management.

Other commands are available for extending the universe.  Many of
these commands cost pennies, which you can obtain in a number of ways.
Full names of exits can be used in place of a go or move command.  The
names "me" and "here" are special; me means the current player, and
here means the current player's location.
More information is available in the reference section of the Library,
north of the Temple.
Remember, no matter how bad it gets, you can always go home.
