# Drive a running instance of MangledMUD through a scripted set of commands
# This is used to test the networking
#
# It could be extended to perform a wider set of tests, but the regression
# commands already do this and they don't require networking, which makes
# them cleaner.
#
# NOTE: One of the tests stresses the MUD looking for memory problems
# its worth using system monitor whilst this tests runs to see if the
# ruby process associated with the MUD starts using tons of memory
# It should stay fairly consistent.
